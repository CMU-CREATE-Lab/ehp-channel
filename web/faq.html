            about their air quality and/or believe their health has been, or could be, affected by the presence of oil
            and gas development near their home. All of the data displayed has been collected at the homes of residents

            EHP collects real-time, PM<sub>2.5</sub> air quality measurements, both inside and outside of residences in close
            proximity to unconventional oil and gas development. The Environmental Health Channel displays EHP's

            <span class="highlight-text">What is involved in EHP's data analysis?</span><br>
            Through years of PM<sub>2.5</sub> data collection, EHP acknowledges that particle (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposures occur at homes
            located in close proximity to unconventional oil and gas development. Also, EHP acknowledges that these
            exposures are capable of leading to adverse health effects, and if examined correctly by researchers and
            health professionals, they may be able to intervene to decrease these adverse health effects. To properly
            identify exposures, EHP has developed a system of data analysis that observes 15-minute intervals of
            real-time PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements. Our analysis examines several parameters of what EHP believes to constitute an
            air quality exposure. These parameters include: peaks per day, peak duration, time between peaks,
            accumulated particle concentration and a baseline measurement.

            <span class="highlight-text">What does EHP define as an exposure (or "peak")?</span><br>
            EHP identifies a peak within datasets as any 15-minute interval of time, containing PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements
            greater than two standard deviations above the mean value of the dataset.

            <span class="highlight-text">How does EHP define: peaks per day, peak duration, time between peaks, accumulated particle concentration, and baseline measurements?</span><br>
            Peaks per day is the number of peaks within a data set occurring within 24-hours. Peak duration is the mean
            of the number of minutes that all peaks lasted. Time between peaks is the mean of the number of hours when
            exposures did not occur. Accumulated particle concentration is the sum of accumulated particle concentration
            of peaks, within the dataset, determined by calculating the area under the curve for each exposure event.
            Baseline measurement is the value which represents the baseline, or mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> value of a home, found by
            calculating the 35th percentile of a home's dataset.

            <span
              class="highlight-text">Why does EHP use these components of PM<sub>2.5</sub> monitoring at each location?</span><br>
            EHP is monitoring individual, personal risk for clinical health evaluation. Repeated peak exposures, even
            when they are of short duration, create a pattern of chemical "doses" that are harmful to health. Physicians
            can use information on "doses" of exposure along with an individual's lung volume and rate of breathing to
            gain more precise indicators of exposure to air pollutants.

            <span class="highlight-text"> Is EHP's data analysis similar to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI)?</span><br>
            EHP developed its analysis program independently. Currently, the EPA has two thresholds for PM<sub>2.5</sub> which are
            considered to be health protective. The first is a 24-hour average (not to exceed 35 ug/m<sup>3</sup>) and the second
            is an annual mean, averaged over 3 years (not to exceed 15 ug/m<sup>3</sup>). EHP has examined PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure events
            and found that by averaging real-time readings into 24-hour intervals, high exposure events, harmful to
            human health, lasting less than an hour are lost, or averaged out, when using such a lengthy average of
            time.

            While the color scheme is similar, the AQI is very different than the Environmental Health Channel.
            Therefore, the colors in the Environmental Health Channel do not represent the same air quality message as
            the EPA. For example, the AQI "red" values vary between 151-200. Whereas, the Environmental Health Channel
            "red" values range anywhere between 3-50, depending on which exposure parameter you're examining.

            We map the data of each statistic (e.g. accumulation per day) to a color spectrum. First, the data is
            transformed into standard scores (z-scores), which are numbers of standard deviations (&sigma;) away from the mean
            value. Then we compute a color spectrum and map the standard scores to the spectrum, which allows users to
            compare the values across zip code regions visually. Yellow colors in the middle of the spectrum indicate
            that the corresponding values are closer to the mean value (from -0.3&sigma; to 0.3&sigma;). Green and red colors at
            opposite ends of the spectrum indicate -3&sigma; and 3&sigma; respectively, (i.e the better and worse results).

            Not quite. Only the data which passes EHP's criteria for inclusion to the website is included. Examples of
            the criteria include the followings. First, for a zip code to display air quality measurements, there must
            be at least 3 environmental datasets within that zip code. Any less would be too small of a sample size to
            adequately portray the mean values measured. Second, all reported health symptoms are reviewed by an EHP
            health professional prior to being included into EHP's health dataset. Any health symptom existing prior to
            the construction of nearby oil and gas infrastructure is not considered to be related to the existence of
            new, nearby oil and gas development. Therefore, the reporting of this symptom is excluded from the
            Environmental Health Channel.
