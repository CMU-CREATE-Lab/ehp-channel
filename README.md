# Environmental Health Channel
The Environmental Health Channel is an interactive web-based platform for creating and sharing environmental sensing and health data narratives. This data, shared by affected residents and collected by the [Environmental Health Project](http://www.environmentalhealthproject.org/) (EHP), includes physical and psychosocial health symptoms, particulate pollution (PM2.5) air measurements, and personal stories from residents. This tool displays this data using visualization and exploratory data analysis techniques. This enables researchers, health professionals, and the public to interactively explore compelling scientific evidence of local impacts of oil and gas drilling.
